## Usage

The Study Guide is a single webpage, showing the entire collection of Notes all at once (there are no sub-pages so far). The Notes are sorted into topics.

There are currently four topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

The Study Guide features a hidden topic lister/chooser, viewable through the console. To access the lister/chooser on Chrome or Firefox:

-Right click anywhere on the page to bring up a context menu

-Select 'Inspect', to bring up the big Developer Tools field in the context menu

-Switch to the 'Console' tab in the Developer Tools field

The lister/chooser lists all four current topics, and chooses a topic at random, all in cheerful language. Every time the page is refreshed, the randomizer will choose a new random topic.
